# How to contribute?

Follow these guidelines to make your and the repositoriy maintainer's work simpler.

## Found a bug?

- **Ensure that the bug has not been reported already**. Before creating a new issue, search for it in [project issues](https://github.com/GDSC-AUM/OpenOcto-DSA/issues).

- If you're are unable to find any open issues for the problem, follow one of the steps mentioned below:

### Contributing to the documentation?

- Make sure you read and understand the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) thoroughly, [open a new issue](https://github.com/GDSC-AUM/OpenOcto-DSA/issues/new), make changes and finally create a pull request. It would be put under review and accepted if appropriate.

### A New Program?

- Want to add something new 😎? Great! [Open a new issue](https://github.com/GDSC-AUM/OpenOcto-DSA/issues/new), include a **clear title and description**.

- Add some **test cases** showing what the program does.

### Bug Fixes?

- Found and fixed a bug 🐜? [Open a new issue](https://github.com/GDSC-AUM/OpenOcto-DSA/issues/new), include a **clear title and description**.

- Make sure to include a **test case** where the program does not show expected behaviour. (Try to include input, expected output and actual output. An explaination of the bug fix would be appreciated).

### Improving an existing program?

- [Open a new issue](https://github.com/GDSC-AUM/OpenOcto-DSA/issues/new), include a **clear title and description**.

- Description should show what was improved (sometimes even changing badly named variables can be considered a improvment) 👍.

    Example:

    ```cpp
    // Bad naming 😣
    int this_is_my_variable_which_counts = -1;
    ```

    ```cpp
    // Better naming 😄
    int counter = -1;
    ```
